  <div>
    It is necessary to map your field names to SEED field names. You can select from the list that appears as you start to type, which is
    based on the Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES), or you can type in your own name, as well as typing in the field name
    from the original datafile.
  </div>

  <div>
    In addition, you need to specify where the field should be associated with Tax Lot data or Property data. This will affect how the data
    is matched and merged, as well as how it is displayed in the Inventory view.
  </div>

  <div>
    Column Mapping Profiles can be used to help you easily and consistently map your data. Note that file header columns defined in the
    profile must match exactly (spaces, lowercase, uppercase, etc.) in order for the corresponding SEED column information to be used.
  </div>

  <div>Field names for matching Properties: Custom ID 1, PM Property ID</div>

  <div>Field names for matching Tax Lots: Custom ID 1, Jurisdiction Tax Lot ID</div>

  <div>
    If there are fields in the datafile mapped to these names, the program will attempt to match on the corresponding values in existing
    records. All of these fields must have the same values between records for the records to match.
  </div>

  <div>
    Matches within the same cycle will be merged together, while matches in different cycles will be associated for cross-cycle analysis.
  </div>

  <div>
    When you click the Map Your Data button, the program will show a grid with the new field names as the column headings and your data in
    the rows. In that view, you can still come back to the initial mapping screen and change the field mapping.
